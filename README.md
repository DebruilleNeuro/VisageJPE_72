Study investigating the impacts of stimulus processing on ERPs of close others.
The results of this study show that our brain might be sensitive to electromagnetic
fields emitted by the brain of a close other. 

This dataset contains data from 2 different experiments with the same experimental conditions: Matthieu Lenne et al. (submitted) and Florence Jarry et Enora Jeuland. (submitted), n=32 and n=40 respectively. 

Stimulus: Paires of participants were presented with neutral faces.
